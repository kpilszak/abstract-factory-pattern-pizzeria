## General info
This project shows usage of abstract factory pattern.  
The main principle is: "Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes."  
In abstract factory pattern we rely on object composition.  
Object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface.  
We define an interface for creating a family of products.
